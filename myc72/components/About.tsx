       It&apos;s hard for me to summarize my personality and my life, so I&apos;m going to reduce myself to talking about my interests in programming, my goals, and some important aspects of my life.
What&apos;s my view on programming? I&apos;m in love with programming its the perfect career for me I have been looking for a tool that gives me the ability to create for years, I like to create stuff it gives me meaning , so when a find coding I knew that was it,  while i was working at a car dealership I apply for a scholarship in march of 2021 for a course named egg and I got in, before the course started I was already studying python, programming concepts and and watching Harvard course cs 50  . when the course started in June, I already knew CSS, HTML, and javascript and was starting to make websites, the course was introductory but it was nice I like it, I finished the course and continued studying on my own React, Typescript, MYSQL, Tailwind ,  and got into web 3 then started studying solidity and web 3 concepts created a nice lottery website using solidity for the smart contract and the third web for the deployment of the contract, now I am studying more deeply React/Javascript and slowly getting into machine learning ,Cibersecurity and Digital marketing .



What can I say about myself?, well I am a very particular introverted person the only thing that matters to me is learning about the world, be it how a car engine works, mythology ,religion, let me tell you something about religion ,it has a giant literature

, the Vedas in India , Jewish kabala , Mormon bible , Christian bible , Muslim Torah ,
all have one thing in common Meditation  if it weren&apos;t for meditation my life would be much worse, if you took the time to read everything, sorry it&apos;s hard for me to abbreviate, but regardless of whether I get a job or not you should meditate it feels good when you get used to it, it&apos;s as if your consciousness leveled up. Thanks for your time
